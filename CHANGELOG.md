- Scaled difficulty based on SQRT of chunks unlocked for more balanced area progression
- Changed impossible scaling to x8 from x16. May need to consider early game impact (minimum requirements)
- lilypads are rarer as a requirement for swamps. Witch loot now has a higher weighting.
- Magma cream in nether waste can no longer be double
